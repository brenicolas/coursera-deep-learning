# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

This repository regroups the code resources of the Coursera online specialization Deep Learning dispensed by Andrew Ng and the team of deeplearning.ai (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning/). It is dispensed by Andrew Ng. 

Please find below the link of the certification that shows the quality of the code in the files: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/MWALJUAFKSYN. I download the files directly from the Coursera Terminal. It means that if you need to check something about the code you have to check the oldest version of the notebooks. Otherwise the notebooks will be empty.

If you are stuck at some points for this course I deeply recommend you to use the resources of the forums available on the Coursera platform. Most of the time you are not the first to face some difficulties.
